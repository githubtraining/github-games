## Welcome to Git Debuggine Techniques

## This GitHub repository is used to demonstrate Git debugging commands in the Git Debugging Techniques course on Pluralsight.

### Course Description

When working on a large Git project, it’s not uncommon to come across code bugs that slow down or block your development process. In such instances, manually sifting through your commit history can be a challenging and time-consuming process.

In this course, Git Debugging Techniques, you’ll learn about three Git commands with different techniques that you can use to track down and identify when a bug was introduced into your codebase. 
- First, you’ll learn how to debug your code through file history using Git Blame.
- Next, you’ll learn how to search through your codebase by binary search using Git Bisect.
- Last, you’ll learn how to search for a string or regular expression using Git Grep. 

At the end of this course, you’ll gain experience using several different Git debugging techniques that you can use to locate and fix bugs within your codebase.
